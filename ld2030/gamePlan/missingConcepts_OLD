Here’s what’s missing as concepts in the masterplan (not “code TODOs”, but game contracts you haven’t locked yet):
	•	Time model: what a “tick” means in real time (and how “24h hunger/water” maps onto ticks), plus day/night (even if it’s “not in v1”, it needs a placeholder).
	•	Progression currency loop: exactly how skill ranks advance + anti-grind rule + what you spend (points/XP) and how much per rank.
	•	Combat contract v1: one concrete formula set (hit, dodge from Athletics, armor mitigation, damage spread/variance, crit or none) so items/skills aren’t floating.
	•	Stress contract: number of levels + exact penalty (what rolls it affects, and by how much).
	•	District objective contract: exactly what makes powerOn/waterOn/ispOn flip off, and the restore loop (steps + required items + number of actions) so “district gameplay” actually exists.
	•	Visibility / info rules: fog-of-war yes/no, what you can see without interacting, and whether you show exact HP vs integrity labels only.
	•	Player death/downtime contract: you wrote a “stand up later / 10 AP / 10 HP” idea, but it’s not tied into a consistent rule for offline/online, protection from spawn-camping, and whether death drops inventory.
	•	Item rules beyond “exists”: stacking, ammo packaging, durability loss triggers, drop rules, and what happens to items in a searched cell over time (persist? despawn?).
	•	Multiplayer interaction rules: PvP allowed or not, stealing/looting other players, grief constraints (especially with doors/barricades), and what ISP actually enables/blocks gameplay-wise.
	•	Win/lose / endgame: what “winning” looks like (rescue? holding districts? curing? extraction?), even if it’s just a stub.
Here are the missing concepts from the masterplan — now LOCKED with concrete V1 answers (not code TODOs):

1) Time model (tick + 24h mapping)
- Tick length (V1): 5 minutes real time.
- 24h = 288 ticks.
- Hunger/Hydration: -1 Hunger and -1 Hydration per 6h (changed from 24H), max -4 hunger & hydration.
- Day/Night (placeholder): derived from world tick modulo 288; cosmetic only in V1.

2) Progression currency loop (skills)
- Currency: Skill Points (SP) on player.
- Gain SP:
  - +1 SP per zombie kill (last-hit credit).
  - +1 SP per 20 meaningful actions (SEARCH / REPAIR / BARRICADE / ATTACK) that actually change state.
- Anti-grind rule: actions only count if state changes:
  - SEARCH counts only if remaining decreases and a roll happens.
  - REPAIR counts only if hp increases.
  - BARRICADE counts only if barricadeLevel changes.
  - ATTACK counts only if damage > 0.
- Rank-up costs per skill:
  - R1: 2 SP
  - R2: 3 SP
  - R3: 4 SP
  - R4: 6 SP
  - R5: 8 SP
  - R6: 10 SP

3) Combat contract (V1 formulas)
- Hit chance:
  - hitChance = clamp(0.10..0.95, base + attackerHitBonus - targetDodge)
  - base = 0.65
  - attackerHitBonus = 0.03 * (FirearmsRank for guns OR MeleeRank for melee)
  - targetDodge = 0.02 * targetAthleticsRank
- Damage:
  - raw = weapon.damage * rand(0.85..1.15)
- Armor mitigation:
  - final = max(1, raw - armorFlat)
  - armorFlat = sum of equipped armor
- Crits: none in V1.
- Barriers vs actors: same combat model, but barriers have targetDodge = 0 and typically armorFlat = 0.

4) Stress contract (levels + penalties)
- Stress levels: 0..4.
- Affects: combat hit chance, repair success/progress, search quality.
- Penalties:
  - hitChance -= 0.05 * stressLevel
  - repairSuccessChance -= 0.10 * stressLevel (if repair has success/fail; otherwise apply to progress per action)
  - searchRareWeightMultiplier *= (1 - 0.15 * stressLevel)
- Dead Calm: effectiveStress = max(0, stressLevel - DeadCalmRank)

5) District objective contract (power/water/ISP)
- District utilities are driven by ONE facility cell per district:
  - TRANSFORMER_SUBSTATION -> powerOn
  - WATER_PLANT (add type) -> waterOn
  - RADIO_STATION (gameplay name: ISP) -> ispOn (we have ISP now, not radio station)
- Flip OFF rule:
  - utility flips OFF if facility cell has ruined=true OR hp <= 0.
- Restore loop (deterministic):
  1) Facility cell must have 0 zombies on it.
  2) Repair facility cell hp to >= 50% using TOOLKIT actions (no parts).
  3) Repair facility infra:
     - Power: fix fuse using FUSE_KIT for 3 actions.
     - Water: fix water using PIPE_PATCH for 3 actions.
     - ISP: fix fuse using FUSE_KIT for 2 actions.
  4) When the above completes -> utility flips ON.
- Zombie takedown: zombies damage facility cell hp and/or its fuse/water as they roam inside (same targeting rules).

6) Visibility / info rules (V1)
- Fog-of-war: OFF (show whole map in V1).
- Without interacting:
  - show building type + floor count from mapMeta; show inside/outside.
  - do NOT show exact HP; show integrity labels only if known.
- On same cell:
  - show exact HP for current cell infra + relevant edge barrier.

7) Player death / downtime contract (V1)
- hp <= 0 -> DOWNED.
- Stand up:
  - pay 10 AP to stand immediately at 10 HP, OR
  - wait until tick regen brings you back to 10 HP then auto-stand - no auto stand. that means stand when player not online! player will stand when they choose to.
- Spawn-camp protection: 1-tick invulnerability on stand-up (cannot be damaged; also cannot attack).
No invulnerability, not needed..
- Inventory drop on downed: OFF in V1.
no, nothing drops. corpse cannot be looted.

8) Item rules beyond “exists” (V1)
- Stacking:
  - Stackable: ammo, bandage, painkiller, antiseptic, water, soda, canned food, MRE, stim, doses.
  - Non-stackable: weapons, armor, backpack, cart, toolkit, generator, fuse_kit, pipe_patch.
- Ammo packaging units:
  - AMMO_9MM: 10 rounds
  - AMMO_SHELL: 5 shells
  - AMMO_556: 10 rounds
- Consumption:
  - guns consume 1 ammo per attack.
- Durability loss:
  - melee: -1 durability on hit.
  - guns: -1 durability per attack.
  - armor: -1 durability when it absorbs damage.
  - toolkit: loses durability when repair increases hp.
- Dropped items persistence:
  - dropped items persist for 24h (288 ticks) then despawn.

9) Multiplayer interaction rules (V1)
- PvP: OFF.
- Stealing/looting other players: OFF.
- Door/barricade grief constraints:
  - debarricade restricted to builder’s party (or builder if no party).
- ISP gameplay effect:
  - Global chat always ON.
  - District chat + DMs require ispOn for sender’s district.

10) Win/lose / endgame stub
- No win condition in V1 (sandbox survival).
- Endgame placeholder: “Rescue Event”
  - Stub condition: restore power + water + ISP in all districts simultaneously for 24h -> extraction window later.
